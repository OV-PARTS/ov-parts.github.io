This Open Vocabulary Part Segmentation **(OV-PARTS)** challenge aims at part-level semantic segmentation based on natural language, which can facilitate various applications in vision and robotics. While Open Vocabulary Object Segmentation has received significant attention, OV-PARTS is under-studied due to two major difficulties:

1. Part definition has an open granularity while objects are usually well-defined.
2. Large foundation models like CLIP exhibit weaker recognition ability for parts than objects.

Therefore, this challenge encourages participants to uncover the potential of existing foundation models for addressing OV-PARTS.
